# Forkify
Hey guys, welcome to Forkify, a javascript based single page app to search recipes. Please check it out and leave some feedback.  
https://forkify4.surge.sh  

# Highlights 
==> New javascripts syntax, ES6, ES7 and some features of ES8.  
==> Use of Webpack to bundle the JS, and HTML files.  
==> Use of Babel to convert the newer syntax to ES5, so all the browsers can support the app.  
==> Modern folder architecture.  

Feel free re-use the source code to your need. Ask me any question, leave some feedback.  
Suggest me ways to make the code more cleaner, better and productive.  
Thanks
